# Gophercises by [Joe Bresee]

A collection of Go (Golang) mini-projects and exercises based on the [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) course by Jon Calhoun. These exercises are designed to help developers build practical Go programming skills by working through real-world examples. Please note some code/packages is provided through this course - but for my learning, these projects are largely written by me to satisfy the requirements of the course.

## üõ† Technologies

- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- Standard library (focus on no external frameworks unless needed)
- CSV, YAML, JSON parsing
- Web development (`net/http`, `mux`)
- File I/O and CLI interfaces
- Go modules

---

## üß† What I Want To Learn

- Improve Go fluency by building hands-on projects.
- Understand and use interfaces, structs, slices, maps, channels, and goroutines.
- Build both command-line tools and web servers using Go's standard library.
- Become competent enough to effectively contribute to open source Go projects
- Write readable, maintainable, idiomatic Go code.

---

## üß† What I‚Äôve Learned So Far

- How to structure a Go project with packages and modules, dependency management
- Parsing CSV and YAML files into Go Structs
- basic use of channels
- URL redirection/handling, using mux, net/http
- Logic for working with maps and slices
- Go's `flag` package
- error handling and debugging in Go

(*This section will grow as I complete more exercises.*)
