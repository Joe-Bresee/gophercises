# Gophercises by Joe Bresee

A collection of Go (Golang) mini-projects and exercises based on the [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) course by Jon Calhoun. These exercises are designed to help developers build practical Go programming skills by working through real-world examples. Please note some code/packages is provided through this course - but for my learning, these projects are largely written by me to satisfy the requirements of the course.

## üõ† Technologies

- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- Standard library (focus on no external frameworks unless needed)
- CSV, YAML, JSON parsing
- Web development (`net/http`, `mux`)
- File I/O and CLI interfaces
- Go modules
- boltDB
- SQL
- html
- css

---

## üß† What I Want To Learn

- Improve Go fluency by building hands-on projects.
- Understand and use interfaces, structs, slices, maps, channels, and goroutines.
- Build both command-line tools and web servers using Go's standard library.
- Become competent enough to effectively contribute to open source Go projects
- Write readable, maintainable, idiomatic Go code.
- Get more fluent with database operations

---

## üß† What I‚Äôve Learned So Far

- How to structure a Go project and how Go packages and modules, and dependency management functions
- Parsing CSV and YAML files into Go Structs
- JSON handling
- Channels
- Webserver: URL redirection/handling, using mux, net/http
- Logic for working with maps and slices
- error handling and debugging in Go
- programming with html templating (I've already learned templating though through Helm Charts)
- recursive html tree traversal
- DB operations using boltDB & SQL
- OS operations
- (Separate) Terraform provider SDK semantics and provider structure (While working on terraform-provider-talos)
- Go testing

(*This section will grow as I complete more exercises.*)
